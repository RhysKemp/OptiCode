# Optimisations

This folder contains the manual, rule-based optimisation implementations used in the OptiCode project.

## Overview

The optimisations in this module are based on a set of predefined rules designed to improve the performance of code manually. These optimisations target execution speed, memory usage, and energy consumption.

### Manual Rule-Based Optimisations

- **Execution Speed**: Optimisations designed to reduce the runtime of the code.
- **Memory Usage**: Rules to minimise memory consumption.
- **Energy Consumption**: Suggestions to optimise for lower energy usage during execution.

## Future Work

In future iterations, the goal is to integrate AI-driven optimisations based on machine learning models that should replace the current iteration and this folder.

This folder will remain here just as a display for the initial pipeline and as a backup if an AI model fails.
