# OptiCode

OptiCode is an AI-powered code optimisation tool that aims to improve code quality and maintainability through automated analysis and suggestions.

## Overview

OptiCode leverages machine learning to analyse code patterns and suggest optimisations. The tool is designed to help developers write more efficient and maintainable code by providing automated recommendations.

## Features

- Code pattern analysis
- Optimisation suggestions
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Integration with common development environments

## Model Details

The current model has the following characteristics:

- Based on transformer architecture
- Trained on open source code repositories
- Vocabulary size: ~50k tokens
- Context window: 2048 tokens

### Model Limitations

- Limited understanding of complex program logic
- May suggest optimizstions that don't consider full project context
- Training data biases can affect suggestions
- Non-deterministic outputs may require human validation

## Current Shortfalls

1. Performance

   - High latency for large files
   - Memory intensive for long code sequences
   - Limited parallel processing capabilities

2. Technical Limitations

   - Incomplete language support
   - Limited handling of external dependencies
   - No support for multi-file refactoring
   - Cannot guarantee semantic preservation

3. Integration
   - No IDE integration options
   - No CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Manual intervention required for many operations

## Future Work

1. Model Improvements

   - Larger context window size
   - More diverse training data
   - Fine-tuning for specific languages/frameworks
   - Better handling of code semantics

2. Features

   - Real-time optimisation suggestions
   - Multi-file refactoring support
   - Integration with more IDEs
   - Automated test generation
   - Performance profiling integration

3. Tooling

   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Git integration for version control
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Custom rule definition system

4. User Experience
   - Interactive optimisation interface
   - Better explanation of suggestions
   - Configuration options for optimization levels
   - Performance impact estimates
   - UI
